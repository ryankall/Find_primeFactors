Given any integer n we will find all the prime factor of that number.


**Unique Prime Factorization
The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every natural number 
greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers, and that 
up to rearrangement of the factors, this product is unique. This is 
called the prime factorization of the number.
